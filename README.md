# cordconv
A coordinate converter made for DCS. Only converts DMS to DDM at the moment.

## Purpose
I made this primarily for the Hoggit GCI. The online GCI only uses DMS, which makes it harder for a A10 or F-16 to look for a new mission on the fly. You can only view the tac-map in-game with targets shown before you spawn/select role. Which is why I made this. Just had an idea and thought it would be a little project to help me in game as well as sharpen my Python. I'll continue to add features and automation (Web Scrapping, communicate with an in-game scratchpad, etc.).

## Install/Setup
There is no setup or install required at the moment. You just download and run!

##Usage
Follow the menu prompts. Get a DMS Coordinate/Lat or Long, like: 44 35' 59.26" N
Enter each step of the coordinate. '44' - Degrees, '35' - Minutes, '59' - Seconds
You will then receive an output, like: (44, 39.983)

That's it!
